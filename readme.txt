Hello,
this app was created for personal use only.

Unzip energie-release.zip to root folder where you want to install it, create database and write down database name, database host, database user and database user password.
When you first open it, it will give you first install page, so you can enter settings. If everything is properly configured, it will redirect you to login page. Use credentials you entered.

Language is mixed Slovak and English in 1.0 version.

You can use it as your free will, just dont edit mine logo and signature at the bottom.

All user passwords stored in database are enrypted by md5 hash after secret string - generated during install process - was added to password.

Enjoy and let me know...
